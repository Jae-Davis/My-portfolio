  <h2>More about Jae</h2>

   <p>After completing school for pharmacy, I realized that pharmacy wasn't my passion. All though I love to create music, draw, design clothes, skate & cut hair, I just didn't see those as career choices, more so as hobbies. As a child I was always interested in how electrical toys operated and what actual got them to work outside of batteries. Once I was able to finally put a name to the to source I was so excited because software development perfectly describes what it is I love to do.</p>

    <p>So I enrolled into thinkful as soon as I could to begin this journey. I can say that for once I am excited about my career path and excited about my future.</p>

    <p>So if you're looking to hire or intern a new developer, please don't hesitate to reach out.  I'm super excited to learn from and build software with like minded developers.</p>
